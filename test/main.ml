(* write a (potentially lengthy) comment describing your approach to
   testing: what you tested, anything you omitted testing, why you
   believe that your test suite demonstrates the correctness of your
   system, explain what modules were tested by OUnit and how test cases
   were developed (black box, glass box, randomized, etc.), explain
   which parts of the system were automatically tested by OUnit vs.
   manually tested. At least 50 passing tests. *)
